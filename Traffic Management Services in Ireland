1. Understanding Vehicle Restraint Systems: Protecting Lives and Infrastructure
What Are Vehicle Restraint Systems?
Vehicle restraint systems are engineered solutions designed to prevent vehicles from leaving the roadway or crossing into dangerous zones, such as pedestrian areas or opposing traffic lanes. These include guardrails, crash barriers, and pedestrian restraint systems that absorb impact and reduce the severity of accidents.

In Ireland, vehicle restraint systems are mandated for high-risk zones on highways, urban roads, and construction sites to safeguard both drivers and pedestrians.

Types of Vehicle Restraint Systems
Crash Barriers: These systems absorb energy during a collision, reducing damage and injury.

Guardrails and Safety Barrier Systems: Placed along the sides of roads, these prevent vehicles from veering off.

Pedestrian Restraint Systems: Protect pedestrians in high-traffic zones.

Temporary Road Barriers: Used during roadworks or temporary traffic management to protect workers and direct vehicles safely.

The road restraint system market in Ireland is continually evolving, integrating new materials and technologies to improve safety and durability.
