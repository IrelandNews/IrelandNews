fermator door systems are the industry standard for smooth, reliable operation.

Premium models—premium lift doors or premium elevator doors—deliver quieter starts, precise levelling, and reduced wear.

Consider fermator automatic doors for lifts where traffic is high.

2.2 Car & Shaft Fixtures

elevator car components include guide shoes, rollers, and buffers; OEM replacements extend service life.

elevator door panels and elevator shaft parts must match original specs to maintain safety certifications.

2.3 Roping & Suspension

Use certified elevator rope from trusted brands like pfeifer drako ropes or verope wire rope.

For crane applications, choose heavy-duty Crane Ropes or crane wire rope.

3. Hoisting & Lifting Systems
3.1 Electric Chain Hoists

Chain Hoists power heavy loads. Choose models like the Chainster for up to 5 t lift capacity.

Understand What Is a Chain Hoist?—leveraging gear reduction for smooth, controlled lifts.

For lighter needs, electric chain hoist 500kg models or portable chain hoist units excel.

3.2 Manual Hoists & Blocks

Inspect manual chain hoist and chain block lifter equipment for wear.

Lever chain block or hand operated lever hoist solutions provide precise load control.

3.3 Slings & Cranes

Choose web slings dublin or lifting slings ireland rated for your loads.

For workshop cranes, consider light crane systems like the Lightster light crane system.

4. Safety & Compliance
4.1 Gates & Edge Protection

lift shaft safety gates or lift safety gates prevent falls into open shafts.

For temporary works, deploy safe gate systems or temporary lift shaft gates.

4.2 Harnesses & Fall Protection

A full-body Safety Harness paired with lanyards ensures worker safety.

Certified fall protection equipment must be tested under HSA rules.

4.3 Certification & Inspections

Perform lifting equipment inspections at required intervals.

Obtain lifting certification from accredited bodies (LEEA).

Follow pat testing hsa guidelines for electrical hoists.

5. Lighting, Communication & Accessories
5.1 Elevator Lighting
